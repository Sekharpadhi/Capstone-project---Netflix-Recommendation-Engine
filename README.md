# Capstone-project---Netflix-Recommendation-Engine
This project builds a movie recommendation system using the Netflix Prize dataset and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). It involves data preprocessing, model building with the surprise library, and recommendation generation. The system predicts movie ratings for users based on their past preferences, offering personalized suggestions.

# Here's a breakdown of the key steps:
# Data Loading and Preprocessing:
The project begins by loading the dataset, which includes customer IDs, movie IDs, and ratings. It then performs data cleaning and preprocessing, including handling missing values, converting data types, and filtering out irrelevant data to enhance the model's performance. Additionally, it loads a dataset containing movie titles for easier interpretation of the recommendations.

# Model Building and Evaluation:
The project utilizes SVD, a matrix factorization technique, to build the recommendation model. It employs the surprise library to create and train the model. Cross-validation is applied to assess the model's performance by calculating the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

# Recommendation Generation:
The trained model is used to generate movie recommendations for a specific user. The code demonstrates this by identifying movies rated highly by the user and predicting ratings for movies they haven't seen. Based on predicted ratings, the top recommendations are presented to the user.

# Conclusion:
The project concludes by highlighting its successful implementation of an SVD-based recommendation system for the Netflix Prize dataset. It notes the achieved RMSE score and suggests areas for future improvement.
Overall, this project demonstrates how SVD can be effectively applied to build a movie recommendation system. It also emphasizes the importance of data preprocessing and model evaluation in achieving accurate and relevant recommendations. I hope this description is helpful. Let me know if you have any further questions.
